This is an MCollective application file which allows mcollective to generate a provisioning requisition for OpenNMS network management system.

IMPORTANT!!!
If you have EXISTING nodes provisioned via the OpenNMS web interface, you will need to tell puppet/mcollective about the existing foreign ID. 

This is easily done by going through the web interface to the admin and editing a provisioning group. Each node will typically have a 
foreign id which is about 13 digits long. Place variables as described below in the "node" definition for your puppet manifest and 
ensure you are using the YAML based facts for mcollective as detailed at http://projects.puppetlabs.com/projects/mcollective-plugins/wiki/FactsFacterYAML

node "mynode.mycompany.tld" {
    $onms-source = "Web Servers"                        ## The OpenNMS provisioning group that this node should be a part of                           
    $onms-services = "ICMP,SNMP"                        ## The comma separated list of services which should be monitored
    $onms-categories = "Production,Servers"             ## A comma separated list of categories to assign this node to in OpenNMS
    $onms-primary-interface = "eth0"                    ## The interface which should be used for monitoring this node
    $onms-label = "${hostname}.recur"                   ## The label which should be used to identify this node in OpenNMS

    . . .
}




Usage:

    mco provision --url "http://opennms.mycompany.com/opennms/rest/" --user admin --pass myadminpass

    --url   : The URL for the rest API of your OpenNMS server.
    --user  : The username with which we will authenticate to the OpenNMS server
    --pass  : The password with which we will authenticate to the OpenNMS server

All other mco filters work as expected.


Examples:

1. Provision all nodes which have the "ssh" class applied.

    mco provision --url "http://opennms.mycompany.com/opennms/rest/" --user admin --pass myadminpass -C ssh

2. Provision all nodes which have FQDNs containing "web"

    mco provision --url "http://opennms.mycompany.com/opennms/rest/" --user admin --pass myadminpass -F fqdn="/web/"

3. Provision ALL nodes

    mco provision --url "http://opennms.mycompany.com/opennms/rest/" --user admin --pass myadminpass
