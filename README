This is an MCollective application file which allows mcollective to generate a provisioning requisition for OpenNMS network management system.

Usage:

    mco provision --services ICMP,SSH,DNS --categories Production,Servers --source default -C snmpd

--services 	- A comma separated list of services which should be monitored
--categories 	- A comma separated list of categories which these nodes should be assigned to
--source	- An OpenNMS foreign source name (Uses "default" if none is specified)

All other mco filters work as expected.
